                <h1>Generation 6: iPhone 5</h1>
                <h2>iPhone 5 Release Date: September 21, 2012</h2>
                <p>
                    The iPhone 5 was released in 2012, a year after the iPhone
                    4S. It was a major update to the iPhone, with a new design,
                    a larger screen, and faster processor. One of the most
                    significant changes with the iPhone 5 was the addition of
                    LTE support. LTE is a new cellular technology that offers
                    much faster speeds than previous cellular technologies. This
                    made the iPhone 5 the first iPhone that could take advantage
                    of the ultra-fast LTE networks that were being offered by
                    AT&T and Verizon at the time. The iPhone 5 also had a new
                    design with a taller, thinner body. The screen was also
                    larger, at 4 inches, and it had a higher resolution. The
                    processor was also faster, and the phone had more memory.
                    The iPhone 5 was a major upgrade to the iPhone, and it
                    helped to keep the iPhone at the forefront of the smartphone
                    market.

                <h2>iPhone 5 Countries and Carriers</h2>
                <p>
                    The iPhone 5 was a huge success, with over 5 million units
                    sold in its first weekend. However, some investors were
                    disappointed with the sales figures, as they had expected
                    even higher numbers. The phone was available in a few
                    countries at first, but by the end of the year, it was
                    available in over 100 countries around the world.
