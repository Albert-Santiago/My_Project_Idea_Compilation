                <h1>Generation 4: iPhone 4</h1>
                <h2>iPhone 4 Release Date: June 24, 2010</h2>
                <p>
                    Apple sold over 30 million iPhones in the first three years
                    of the phone's history. The company wanted to keep
                    innovating, so they released the iPhone 4 in 2010. The
                    iPhone 4 was a complete makeover of the iPhone, with a new
                    design and new features. The design of the iPhone 4 was
                    completely new. It had a glass front and back and a
                    stainless steel frame. The screen was also larger and had a
                    higher resolution. The camera was improved, the processor
                    was faster, and the software was updated. The iPhone 4 was a
                    huge success, and it helped to keep the iPhone at the
                    forefront of the smartphone market. Apple's thirst for
                    innovation is what has helped to make the iPhone such a
                    successful product.

                <h2>iPhone 4 Countries and Carriers</h2>
                <p>
                    The iPhone 4 was only available on AT&T in the US for the
                    first three years. However, in 2011, Apple released a new
                    version of the iPhone that could work on CDMA networks. This
                    meant that the iPhone could now be used on Verizon and
                    Sprint in the US, which ended the exclusivity between Apple
                    and AT&T. The first iPhone on Verizon was sold on February
                    10, 2011. The phone became available to Sprint customers in
                    October of that year. This was a major change in iPhone
                    history, as it opened up the iPhone to a wider range of
                    customers in the US. It also helped to boost sales of the
                    iPhone, as more people were now able to use it on their
                    preferred carrier.
