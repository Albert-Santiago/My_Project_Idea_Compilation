                <h1>Generation 15.1: iPhone 11</h1>
                <h2>Release Date: September 10, 2019</h2>
                <p>
                    Apple's decision to return to the traditional numbering
                    system for the iPhone 11 was a welcome change. The previous
                    naming convention was confusing, and it was unclear whether
                    Apple was transitioning to Roman numerals. The iPhone 11 is
                    a minor upgrade over the iPhone XS, but it does have some
                    new features. These include a new triple-lens rear camera
                    system, a new Night mode for taking photos in low-light
                    conditions, and a new U1 chip for improved spatial
                    awareness. The iPhone 11 is also more affordable than the
                    iPhone XS, starting at $699. This makes it a more attractive
                    option for people who want the latest iPhone but don't want
                    to spend a lot of money. Overall, the iPhone 11 is a good
                    phone, but it's not a revolutionary upgrade. However, the
                    new features are welcome, and the more affordable price tag
                    makes it a more attractive option for many people.
