                    Apple released the
                    iPhone 13 in 2021, following the same pattern as the iPhone
                    12 release in 2020. Both releases featured two different
                    versions: the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini, and the iPhone
                    13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max. The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13
                    mini are the more affordable models in the lineup, while the
                    iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max are the more high-end
                    models. Both lineups feature a number of new features, such
                    as a Cinematic mode for video recording and a longer battery
                    life.
