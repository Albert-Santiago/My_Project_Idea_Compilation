        <h1>The first Generation iPhone</h1>
        <h2>Release Date - June 29, 2007</h2>
        <p>
            Steve Jobs took the stage at the MacWorld convention on January 9th,
            2007, announcing the commencement of iPhone history and the official
            start of the smartphone era.
        </p>
        <p>
            Later that year, on June 29, 2007, the initial iPhone hit the
            shelves in the United States, marking the official start of a
            transformative period.
        </p>
        <p>
            To say that Jobs accurately predicted that this new product would
            revolutionize the phone industry would be an understatement. By
            September of the same year, Apple had already sold one million
            iPhones. Since then, sales have steadily increased, reaching over 2
            billion iPhones sold by 2017. But what made this first iPhone so
            special and distinctive?
