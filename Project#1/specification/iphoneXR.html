                <h1>Generation 14.2: iPhone XR</h1>
                <h2>Release Date: October 26, 2018:</h2>
                <p>
                    The iPhone XR was released in 2018 as a more affordable
                    alternative to the iPhone XS. It has a 6.1-inch LCD display,
                    which is not as sharp as the OLED display on the iPhone XS.
                    However, the iPhone XR has the same A12 Bionic processor as
                    the iPhone XS, so it is just as fast. The iPhone XR also has
                    a single-lens rear camera, while the iPhone XS has a
                    dual-lens rear camera. However, the iPhone XR's single-lens
                    camera is still very good, and it takes great photos in most
                    lighting conditions. The iPhone XR is available in a wider
                    range of colors than the iPhone XS. It is available in six
                    colors: white, black, blue, yellow, coral, and (PRODUCT)RED.
                    The iPhone XR starts at $799, which is $200 less than the
                    starting price of the iPhone XS. It is a good option for
                    people who want an iPhone with the latest features but don't
                    want to spend a lot of money.
