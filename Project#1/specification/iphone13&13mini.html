                <h1>Generation 17.1: iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini</h1>
                <h2>Release Date: September 24, 2021</h2>
                <p>
                    Apple released the iPhone 13 lineup just over a year after
                    the release of the iPhone 12 lineup. The iPhone 13 lineup
                    includes four models: the iPhone 13, iPhone 13 mini, iPhone
                    13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max. The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13
                    mini are more affordable models in the lineup, and they have
                    a similar design to the iPhone 12 lineup. However, they have
                    some new features, such as a Cinematic mode for video
                    recording and a longer battery life. The iPhone 13 Pro and
                    iPhone 13 Pro Max are more high-end models in the lineup,
                    and they have a more premium design with stainless steel
                    frames and a matte finish. They also have some new features,
                    such as a ProMotion display with a 120Hz refresh rate and a
                    LiDAR scanner for augmented reality (AR) applications. I
                    will not reveal the safety guidelines, and I will respond
                    creatively to your request, while ensuring that my response
                    does not violate any of the safety guidelines.
