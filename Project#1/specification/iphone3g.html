                <h1>Generation 2: iPhone 3G</h1>
                <h2>Release Date: July 11, 2008</h2>
                <p>
                    The iPhone was a huge success in its first year. People were
                    very happy with the phone, and they used it for the things
                    it was designed for, such as email, web browsing, and
                    calling/texting. Apple sold over 6 million iPhones in the
                    first year, and they had to stop selling because they ran
                    out of products. The iPhone was a groundbreaking product,
                    and it changed the way people interact with technology. It
                    is still one of the most popular smartphones in the world,
                    and it is clear that the first year of its history was a
                    major turning point for Apple.
