                <h1>Generation 13: iPhone X</h1>
                <h2>Release Date: November 3, 2017</h2>
                <p>
                    Apple had been releasing iPhones that were very similar to
                    the previous year's models for a few years. Then, they
                    released the iPhone X, which was a major departure from the
                    previous models. It had a new design, new features, and a
                    new price tag. The iPhone X was more expensive than the
                    previous models, but it was also more powerful and had
                    better features. It was a commercial success, and it helped
                    to revitalize the iPhone franchise. Apple also broke with
                    recent tradition when releasing the iPhone X. They only
                    offered one version of the phone, instead of the usual two
                    or three versions. This was a risky move, but it paid off.
                    The iPhone X was a hit with consumers, and it helped to show
                    that Apple was still capable of innovating.
