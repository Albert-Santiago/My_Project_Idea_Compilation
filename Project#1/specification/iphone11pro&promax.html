                <h1>Generation 15.2: iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max</h1>
                <h2>Release Date: September 20, 2019</h2>
                <p>
                    Apple also announced two more iPhones in 2019: the iPhone 11
                    Pro and the iPhone 11 Pro Max. These phones are more
                    expensive than the iPhone 11, but they have some additional
                    features. The iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max have the same A13
                    Bionic processor as the iPhone 11, but they have a longer
                    battery life. The iPhone 11 Pro is designed to last an
                    additional 4 hours longer than the iPhone XS, and the iPhone
                    11 Pro Max is designed to last an additional 5 hours longer
                    than the iPhone XS Max. The iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max also
                    have OLED Super Retina displays, while the iPhone 11 has an
                    LCD Liquid Crystal display. OLED displays have better color
                    reproduction and contrast than LCD displays. The iPhone 11
                    Pro starts at $999, and the iPhone 11 Pro Max starts at
                    $1,099. They are a good option for people who want the
                    latest iPhone with the best features.
