                <h1>Generation 16.1: iPhone 12 and 12 Mini</h1>
                <h2>Release Date: October 13, 2020</h2>
                <p>
                    The iPhone 12 was released on June 22, 2020, at Apple's
                    Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC). Pre-orders for the
                    iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro began on October 16, 2020, and
                    the phones hit stores on October 23, 2020. Pre-orders for
                    the iPhone 12 Mini and iPhone 12 Pro Max started on November
                    6, 2020, and they hit stores on November 16, 2020. The
                    iPhone 12 was released in the midst of the COVID-19
                    pandemic, so Apple held the WWDC event online for the first
                    time in its history. The event was streamed live to an
                    audience of about 1.2 million people on YouTube. The iPhone
                    12 was a major update over the previous generation of
                    iPhones. It featured a new design with flat edges, a faster
                    A14 Bionic chip, and support for 5G cellular networks. The
                    iPhone 12 also had a new camera system with improved Night
                    mode capabilities. The iPhone 12 was a commercial success,
                    and it helped to boost Apple's sales during the COVID-19
                    pandemic. The phone was well-received by critics and
                    consumers, and it was praised for its design, performance,
                    and camera.
