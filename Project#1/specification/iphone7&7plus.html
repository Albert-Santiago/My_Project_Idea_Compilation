                <h1>Generation 11: iPhone 7 and 7 Plus</h1>
                <h2>Release Date: September 16, 2016</h2>
                <p>
                    Apple released the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus a year after the
                    iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. The new phones looked similar to the
                    previous models, but there was one major difference: Apple
                    removed the headphone jack. This meant that users would have
                    to connect their headphones to the phone using Bluetooth,
                    which was a new requirement for iPhone users. The decision
                    to remove the headphone jack was controversial, and many
                    people criticized Apple for making the change. However,
                    Apple defended the decision, saying that it was necessary to
                    make the phone more water-resistant and to free up space for
                    other components. Ultimately, the decision to remove the
                    headphone jack was a gamble by Apple. It was a move that
                    could have alienated some customers, but it also had the
                    potential to make the iPhone more appealing to others. Only
                    time will tell whether Apple's gamble will pay off.
