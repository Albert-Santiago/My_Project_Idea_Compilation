                <h1>Generation 10: iPhone SE</h1>
                <h2>iPhone SE Release Date March 31, 2016</h2>
                <p>
                    Apple released the iPhone SE six months after the iPhone 6S.
                    The SE was not a new kind of phone, but rather an upgraded
                    version of the iPhone 5. It had the same 4-inch screen as
                    the iPhone 5, but it had a faster processor, a better
                    camera, and longer battery life. The iPhone SE was popular
                    because it gave people who wanted a smaller phone a choice
                    other than the iPhone 5S. It was also a good option for
                    people who wanted a more affordable iPhone.
