                <h1>Generation 7: iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C</h1>
                <h2>iPhone 5S and 5C Release Date: September 20, 2013</h2>
                <p>
                    Apple released the iPhone 5S and 5C in 2013. This was the
                    first time that Apple released two iPhones at the same time.
                    The iPhone 5S was a high-end phone with a lot of new
                    features, while the iPhone 5C was a more affordable phone
                    with a plastic body. The release of two iPhones was a way
                    for Apple to compete with other phone companies, such as
                    Samsung. Samsung was releasing phones that were similar to
                    the iPhone, but at a lower price. By releasing the iPhone
                    5C, Apple was able to offer people a more affordable option.
                    The differences between the iPhone 5S and 5C show that Apple
                    was starting to change its perspective. In the past, Apple
                    had only released one iPhone per year, and it was always a
                    high-end phone. However, with the release of the iPhone 5C,
                    Apple was starting to recognize that there was a market for
                    more affordable iPhones.

                <p>
                    The iPhone 5 did not sell as well as expected, despite
                    selling 5 million phones in the first weekend. This may have
                    been why Apple released two phones at the same time the
                    following year. The iPhone 5S and 5C sold just over 9
                    million phones on the day they were released, which was a
                    success for Apple.
