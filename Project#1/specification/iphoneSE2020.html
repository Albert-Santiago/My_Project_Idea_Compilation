                <h1>Generation 16.3: The iPhone SE (Mk. 2)</h1>
                <h2>Release Date: April 15, 2020</h2>
                <p>
                    Apple released a new iPhone SE in 2020, after a two-year
                    hiatus. The original iPhone SE was released in 2016, and it
                    was a small, affordable iPhone that resembled the iPhone 5.
                    The new iPhone SE is also small and affordable, but it has
                    the internals of the iPhone 11. The new iPhone SE has a
                    4.7-inch Retina display, the A13 Bionic chip, and a
                    12-megapixel rear camera. It also has Touch ID, which is a
                    fingerprint sensor that is built into the home button. The
                    new iPhone SE is a good option for people who want a small,
                    affordable iPhone with the latest features. It is also a
                    good option for people who prefer Touch ID over Face ID.
