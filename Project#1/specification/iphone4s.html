                <h1>Generation 5: iPhone 4S</h1>
                <h2>iPhone 4S Release Date: October 14, 2011</h2>
                <p>
                    The iPhone 4S was released in October 2011, after several
                    years of releasing the iPhone in the summer. It was an
                    interim update to the phone, with some new features and
                    increased functionality. However, most of the device stayed
                    the same. The iPhone 4S was the first iPhone to be available
                    on all three major US networks, which helped to boost sales.
                    The phone sold over 1 million units on its first day and
                    over 4 million units in its first weekend. The release of
                    the iPhone 4S was also a momentous one because it was just
                    nine days after the death of Steve Jobs, one of Apple's
                    founders and one of the world's most well-known
                    entrepreneurs. Jobs' death was a major loss for Apple and
                    for the tech industry as a whole.

                <p>
                    The iPhone 4S was a major release for Apple, as it was the
                    first iPhone to be available on all three major US networks.
                    It was also the first time that a full version of the iPhone
                    was released in China. This gave Apple unprecedented access
                    to one of the world's largest markets. Prior to the release
                    of the iPhone 4S, there were counterfeit and stolen iPhones
                    on the market in China. However, the release of the iPhone
                    4S helped to legitimize the iPhone in China and made it more
                    accessible to consumers. The release of the iPhone 4S was a
                    major milestone for Apple and helped to solidify the
                    company's position as a global leader in the smartphone
                    market.
