                <h1>Generation 16.2: iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max</h1>
                <h2>Release Date: October 13, 2020</h2>
                <p>
                    Apple released four new iPhones in 2020: the iPhone 12,
                    iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max. The
                    iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max are the higher-end
                    models, and they have a number of features that the iPhone
                    12 and iPhone 12 mini do not have. One of the biggest
                    differences between the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max
                    is the camera. The iPhone 12 Pro has a triple-lens rear
                    camera system, while the iPhone 12 Pro Max has a quad-lens
                    rear camera system. The iPhone 12 Pro Max also has a larger
                    sensor in its main camera, which allows it to take better
                    photos in low-light conditions. The iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone
                    12 Pro Max also have a LiDAR scanner, which is a new sensor
                    that can be used for augmented reality (AR) applications.
                    The LiDAR scanner allows the iPhone to measure the distance
                    between itself and objects in the real world, which can be
                    used to create more realistic AR experiences. The iPhone 12
                    Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max also have a stainless steel frame,
                    while the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini have an aluminum
                    frame. The stainless steel frame is more durable than the
                    aluminum frame, and it gives the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12
                    Pro Max a more premium look and feel. Overall, the iPhone 12
                    Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max are the more powerful and
                    feature-rich iPhones of the 2020 lineup. They are a good
                    option for people who want the best possible iPhone
                    experience.
