                <h1>Generation 9: iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus</h1>
                <h2>Release Date: September 25, 2015</h2>
                <p>
                    The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus are minor updates to the iPhone 6
                    and 6 Plus, but they offer significant improvements to
                    performance and user experience. The only difference between
                    the 6S and 6S Plus is the size, with the 6S being larger.
                    The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus have a new A9 processor that is
                    70% faster than the A8 processor in the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.
                    They also have a new 3D Touch feature that allows users to
                    interact with the screen in a more intuitive way.
                    Additionally, they have a new 12-megapixel camera with
                    improved image quality. Finally, they run on the new iOS 9
                    operating system, which has new features and improvements.
                    Overall, the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus are significant upgrades
                    over the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, and they offer a better
                    overall user experience.

                <h2>iPhone 6s Sales</h2>
                <p>
                    The iPhone 6S was a very successful phone for Apple. It sold
                    very well and broke the company's record for first weekend
                    sales. However, some people believe that it was also a
                    turning point in Apple's history. They argue that it became
                    harder for Apple to achieve explosive growth after the
                    iPhone 6S, as competition increased and it became more
                    difficult to come up with new features that people really
                    wanted. Nevertheless, the iPhone remained Apple's core
                    product, and subsequent versions of the phone continued to
                    be popular.
