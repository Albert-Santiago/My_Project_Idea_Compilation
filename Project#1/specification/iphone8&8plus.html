                    starting at $599 and $699, respectively. However, they were
                    also more powerful and had better cameras. The iPhone 8 and
                    8 Plus were popular with consumers who wanted the latest and
                    greatest iPhone. They were also popular with businesses that
                    wanted to use the latest technology in their workforce.
