                <h1>Generation 14.1: iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max</h1>
                <h2>Release Date: September 21, 2018:</h2>
                <p>
                    The iPhone XS and XS Plus are the latest iPhones from Apple.
                    They are essentially improved versions of the iPhone X, with
                    a faster processor, a better camera, and a more
                    water-resistant design. The iPhone XS has a 5.8-inch screen,
                    while the iPhone XS Plus has a 6.5-inch screen. Both phones
                    have a bezel-less design, and they use Face ID for facial
                    recognition. The iPhone XS and XS Plus are powered by the
                    A12 Bionic chip, which is the fastest chip ever used in a
                    smartphone. They also have a new dual-camera system on the
                    back, which takes better photos in low-light conditions. The
                    iPhone XS and XS Plus are both water-resistant up to 2
                    meters for up to 30 minutes. This means that you can use
                    them in the rain or even take them swimming. The iPhone XS
                    and XS Plus are available in three colors: silver, gold, and
                    space gray. They start at $999 for the iPhone XS and $1,099
                    for the iPhone XS Plus.
